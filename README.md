# Basic OpenGL with GLFW: Fragment Shaders

This program introduces basic concepts involved in writing an OpenGL program.

# About

Fragment Shaders operate on each fragment/pixel, that you draw.
This example builds on top of the Vertex Shaders example, and demonstrates interleaving vertex data, and passing it from the vertex to the fragment shader, to add colors to each vertex.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
